# Missing Palette Commands

The _Command Palette_ feature of Sublime Text 2 is really useful.
Unfortunately, many useful commands have been omitted and are only
available through the main menu.

This package provides a `.sublime-commands` file that contains
the missing commands.

## Installation

The upstream repo, https://github.com/fjl/Sublime-Missing-Palette-Commands,
is registered with Package Control. So if you have Package Control, you're
all set.

Alternatively, take your Terminal to the folder you are placed in if you
select "Preferences > Browse Packages...", and:

    git clone https://github.com/felixrabe/Sublime-Missing-Palette-Commands.git

You should be able to use this package without restarting Sublime Text.
